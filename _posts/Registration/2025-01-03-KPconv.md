### KPConv: Flexible and Deformable Convolution for Point Clouds

... as done in **KPConv [36] to obtain the downsampled voxel points** $\hat{X}$. The downsample iteration is terminated when the total number of occupied voxels in the current sampled voxel feature grid is less than 1.5K.

#### 3D point cloud segmentation or 3D simultaneous localization and mapping rely on non-grid structured data: point clouds.

A point cloud is a set of points in 3D (or higher-dimensional) space.

In many applications, the points are coupled with corresponding features like colors. In this work, we will always consider a point cloud as those two elements: 

- the points $P \in R^{N \times 3}$ 
- the features $F \in R^{N \times D}$

Such **a point cloud is a _sparse_ structure** that has the property to be **_unordered_**, which makes it very different from a grid.

However, it shares a common property with a grid which is essential to the definition of convolutions: it is **_spatially localized_**.

- **In a grid**, the features **are localized by their index in a matrix**.
- **In a point cloud**, the features **are localized by their corresponding point coordinates**.

Thus, the points are to be considered as structural elements, and the features as the real data.
