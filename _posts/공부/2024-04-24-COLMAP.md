### COLMAP에서 구하는 camera poses에서 R,T는 R_c2w, T_w2c 입니다.

The reconstructed pose of an image is specified as the projection from world to the camera coordinate system of an image using a quaternion (QW, QX, QY, QZ) and a translation vector (TX, TY, TZ). 
The quaternion is defined using the Hamilton convention, which is, for example, also used by the Eigen library. 
The coordinates of the projection/camera center are given by -R^t * T, where R^t is the inverse/transpose of the 3x3 rotation matrix composed from the quaternion and T is the translation vector. 
The local camera coordinate system of an image is defined in a way that the X axis points to the right, the Y axis to the bottom, and the Z axis to the front as seen from the image.
