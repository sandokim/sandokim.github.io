The two most common parallel imaging approaches are

- SENSE (sensitivity encdoing)
- GRAPPA (generalized autocalibrating partially parallel acquisition


### SENSE

**SENSE** is a reconstruction approach that **is formulated in the image domain** as a **linear inverse problem** with a priori knowledge of the **receiver sensitivities.**

### GRAPA

**GRAPPA**: the reconstrution is an **interpolation in k-space using shift-invariant convolutional kernels** to **estimate missing k-space lines** from acquired lines, which constitutes a linear reconstruction method.

- **These convolutional kernels are determined from a small amount of fully sampled reference data**, referred to as **autocalibration signal (ACS).**

 ### SPIRiT 

 **SPIRiT**: iterative self-consistent parallel imaging reconstruction, which iteratively performs local interpolation and enforces data consistency has also been proposed, facilitating the use of regularization in the reconstruction process.
