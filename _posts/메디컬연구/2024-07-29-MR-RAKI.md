The two most common parallel imaging approaches are

- SENSE (sensitivity encdoing)
- GRAPPA (generalized autocalibrating partially parallel acquisition


### SENSE

**SENSE** is a reconstruction approach that **is formulated in the image domain** as a **linear inverse problem** with a priori knowledge of the **receiver sensitivities.**

### GRAPA

**GRAPPA**: the reconstrution is an **interpolation in k-space using shift-invariant convolutional kernels** to **estimate missing k-space lines** from acquired lines, which constitutes a linear reconstruction method.

- **These convolutional kernels are determined from a small amount of fully sampled reference data**, referred to as **autocalibration signal (ACS).**

 ### SPIRiT 

 **SPIRiT**: iterative self-consistent parallel imaging reconstruction, which iteratively performs local interpolation and enforces data consistency has also been proposed, facilitating the use of regularization in the reconstruction process.

 
### Clinical Radiologists

- Although the **inherent denoising properties of CS-based techniques are desirable**, the need for incoherent undersampled acquisitions, as well as its residual artifacts that are not readily accepted by clinical radiologists, have hindered its deployment.
- Therefore, **even though noise amplification remains a challenge for the linear reconstruction algorithms used in parallel imaging**, these approaches continue to be the prominent technique for accelerated imaging in clinical MRI.


### The focus of the MRI reconstruction

- The focus of the MRI reconstruction community has been on **generating more advanced regularizers** by training on large amounts of data sets, along with both random and uniform undersampling patterns.
- **Commonly, this training is performed in a manner that is not patient- or scan-specific, and there fore requires large databases of MR images.**

### RAKI

- RAKI is a k-space reconstruction method that uses deep learning on a small amount of scan-specific ACSdata.
- This study focuses on uniformly undersampled acquisitions, to improve the quality of parallel imaging reconstructions and for integration with existing data acquisition approaches.
- However, extensions to other sampling patterns such as random and non-Cartesian are possible within the described k-space method.
- Unlike most recent deep learning approaches, the proposed scheme does not require any training database of images.
- Instead, the neural networks are trained for each specific scan, or set of scans, **with a limited amount of ACS data, simliar to GRAPPA.**

### RAKI contribution

- ***Instead of*** **generating linear convolutional kernels from the ACS data as in k-space interpolation-based methods such as GRAPPA**, RAKI learns nonlinear convolutional neural networks from the ACS data.
- Using scan- and subject-specific deep learning, and learning all the necessary neural network parameters from the ACS data, any dependence on training databases or assumptions about image compressibility are avoided.
- RAKI is non-linear reconstruction approach.
- Phantom experiments and in vivo imaging are performed, comparing RAKI to the GRAPPA parallel imaging approach.


### Redundancies in the multi-coil acquisition

- Because the encdoing process in a multi-coil MRI acquisition is linear, the reconstruction for sub-sampled data is also expected to be linear.
- This is the premise of linear parallel imaging methods, which aim to estimate the underlying reconstruction process that exploits redundancies in the mmulti-coil acquisition, using a linear system with a few degrees of freedom.
- These degrees of freedom
  - captured in the sampll convolutional kernel sizes for GRAPPA
  - or the smooth coil sensitivity maps for SENSE
- In essence, linear functions with such limited degrees of freedoms form a subset of all linear functions.
- **In linear parallel imaging, the underlying reconstruction is approximated with a function from this restricted subset.**

### RAKI에서는 non-linear mapping 사용

- We hypothesize that this restricted, yet non-linear, function space defined through CNNs enables to non-linearly learn redundancies among coils, **without learning specific k-space characteristics**, which may lead to overfitting.
- This is simliar to the GRAPPA reconstruction, which successfully extracts such redundancies with a linear procedure, **without adapting to k-space signal characteristics.**
- The idea of using a larager class of nonlinear functions in **modeling redundancies among coils for GRAPPA has also been explored previously**, although a fixed nonlinear kernel mapping was used instead of the deep learning strategies explored here.
- Therefore, **the modeling of the multi-coil system with a non-linear approximation with few degrees of freedom**, instead of linear approximation with similarly few degrees of freedom, **is hypothesized to extract comparable coil information without overfitting**, while offering improved noise resilience.

### Noise in the Calibration data & non-linear estimation

- Another reason for using non-linear estimation relates to the presence of noise in the calibration data.
- For the GRAPPA formulation above, there is noise in both the target data, b, and the calibration matrix, A.
- When both sources of noise are present, it has been shown that linear convolutional kernels incur a bias when estimated via least squares, and this bias leads to non-linear effects on the estimation of missing k-space lines from acquired ones.
- In the presence of such data imperfections, which are in addition to the model mistmatches related to the degrees of freedom described earlier, a non-linear approximation procedure may improve reconstruction quality and reduce noise amplification.
